        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A smash burger is similar to a bruger but the difference lies in the patties,<br>
            as smash patties are smashed on the grill in order to sear them more, thus giving<br>
            a distinct flavor!<br>
            Let's begin!
        </p>
        <p>Original recipe <a href="https://sugarspunrun.com/smash-burger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground beef</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Buns</li>
            <li>Toppings of your desire</li>
            <li>Any sauce you want</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Prep the meat.</b> Allot 4 oz (113g) per burger. Be very gentle and just loosely form<br>
                the meat into round balls. Sprinkle salt and pepper on the tops of each ball. Pop this<br>
                in the fridge or freezer while you start heating the pan</li>
            <li>Lightly oil a cast iron pan and <b>heat over medium-high heat until smoking.</b> It is<br>
                essential that the pan be <b>very hot/smoking.</b> Add a ball of the chilled and seasoned<br>
                ground beef to the pan, seasoned side down, then <b>immediately press straight down until flat.</b></li>
            <li><b>Cook</b> until a crust forms (approximately 1 minute, don't cook either side too long or you'll<br>
                make the burgers tough). While this cooks, sprinkle the surface of the patty with additional<br>
                salt and pepper. Next, use a spatula to scrape up the burger and flip. Make sure you scrape<br>
                that caramelized crust with the patty!</li>
            <li>Cook the burger until done, about 45 seconds or so, before transferring to a clean plate. If you'd<br>
                like, you can add a slice of cheese here, too, so it will start melting. Then transfer the burger<br>
                to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm.</li>
            <li><b>Toast the buns.</b> Add butter to the hot pan, and, once melted, turn off the pan and add your buns<br>
                cut-side down. Cook until the buns are warm and toasted (this takes only seconds), then serve!</li>
        </ol>
