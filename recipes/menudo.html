            <li>1 teaspoon of Mexican oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If your tripe has been bleached (white color), soak it in a couple changes of cold water for a few hours to get rid of the chlorine smell.<br>
                If you are using unbleached tripe (grey or greenish brown), thoroughly clean it under cold water and remove any extra fat on the smooth side.
            </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil then add the tripe and trotters. Boil for about 5 minutes then drain, discarding the water, <br>
                and wash the tripe and foot clean of any brown gunk that's collected on the surface
            </li>
            <li>
                Wash the pot out and return the cleaned tripe and trotter to the pot then add all the ingredients for the braising liquid.<br>
                Cover and bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to low and simmer for 3 hours. Turn off the heat and allow it to cool to room temperature.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the tripe and brush off any spices or brown stuff. Slice it into Â½" x 2" strips. Remove the trotters, clean and strip<br>
                off the meat and tendon then roughly chop. Strain the stock through a double mesh strainer into a bowl and press on the solids.<br>
                Wash out the pot and add the chopped tripe and trotter back into the pot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the oven rack in the lower middle position and preheat to 350 degrees F. Tear the guajillo chilies open and discard the stems<br>
                and seeds. Flatten the dried chilies on a foil lined baking sheet then spritz with cooking spray. Put the chilies in the oven for about<br>
                5 minutes or until you start smelling sweet and peppery, be careful not to burn them. Remove them from the oven and cover with very hot tap<br>
                water and allow them to rehydrate (about 15-20 minutes)
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain the chilies and put them in a blender with about half the stock. Puree until smooth, adding more stock if needed. Strain the chili<br>
                mixture through a double mesh strainer into the pot with the tripe and trotters. Once you have strained the chili mixture, pour the rest of<br>
                the stock through the strainer into the pot, pressing on any remaining solids.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are using frozen hominy, measure out 3 cups into the pot. If you are using canned hominy, wash and soak in cold water to get rid of the<br>
                "canned" taste. Add the rest of the menudo ingredients, lightly salt to taste and simmer uncovered for about an hour, until the tripe has taken<br>
                on the color of the chilies and the soup is nice and thick. Check once last time for salt and augment if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                It's best if you let it sit overnight for the flavors to mingle, but you can also eat it right away. Serve with tortillas, chopped sweet onions,<br>
                cilantro and lots of lime.
